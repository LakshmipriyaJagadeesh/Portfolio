Project Title: Data 1202: Data Analytics Tools - Lab 1

Short Description: 
This lab provides hands-on experience in using Python (pandas) for data preprocessing when importing data from a SQL database. Participants will learn how to establish connections to a MySQL server, run both simple and complex SQL queries, and read the query results into Pandas Data Frames.

Getting Started:
Prerequisites
•	Basic understanding of Python programming language.
•	Familiarity with SQL databases and SQL queries.
•	Python installed on your machine.
•	Access to a MySQL server.

Installing
Install the required libraries by running: pip install pandas sqlalchemy pymysql

Running the Tests :
Breakdown of Tests
•	Set Up the Environment to connect to the MYSQL server
Install Pymysql package.
Create an engine to connect to the MySQL server.
•	Run Simple Query
Read a simple SQL query from the database into a data frame.
Print the first few rows of the data frame.
•	Run Complex Query
Read a complex SQL query with aggregation and filtering from the database into a data frame.
Print the DataFrame with aggregated sales data for Action genre games released after 2005.
